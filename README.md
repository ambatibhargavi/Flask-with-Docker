# Flask-with-python


I successfully containerized a Python Flask application using Docker, streamlining its deployment and scaling processes. By creating a Docker image for the Flask app, I encapsulated the application and its dependencies into a portable container, ensuring consistency across different environments. This approach simplifies deployment, facilitates scaling, and enhances reproducibility. The project demonstrates my ability to leverage containerization for efficient application management and aligns with best practices in modern software development.
